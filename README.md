## Hulu clone

This clone is supposed to recreate the frontend side of the app. I used IMDB API to fetch movies and the different types of filters.

To run the app, you just need to:

1. set the API_KEY environment variable, correspondent to IMDB API_key
2. run the app with [npm run|yarn] dev.

The project uses NextJS and tailwind.
